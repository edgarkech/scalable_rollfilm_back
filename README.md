# Scalable rollfilm back - 6x9...6x24 

_This is my attempt to create a scalable large format field camera design.
For now I am re-engineering my old 6x12 TinkerCAD-design, which was already available here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2894651 _

## Project goals:
- of course a 3d printable and usable rollfilm back.
- different formats possible with type 120 rollfilm - from 6x6 up to 6x24 (depending on the targeted camera format) 
- The design should be scalable for being used with 4x5", 5x7" or even 8x10" large format cameras by just changing a handful of variables.
- Improving my OpenSCAD skills. Learning to use it efficiently. Learning to do good parametric development/design.
- Learning git/github and sharing my code with other people
- Checking out the limits of home 3D printing with a very limited set of available tools

## Some technical goals:
- modular design
- all parts must be either 3D-printable or easily available.
- no special tools required besides a decent 3D printer and some common tools like little files, screwdrivers, sanding paper, cutter, scissors, ...
- no exotic third party parts/components
- form follows function
- KISS

## Early design decisions:
- nothing notable yet

## to do / next steps
- nothing notable yet
